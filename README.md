# pyscripts #

Collection of Python 3.4+ scripts. I add more from time to time. For more
information on each script, refer to the README.md in the script's directory.

## Setup & Usage ##

All scripts in this repository can be directly executed with your Python
interpreter. Some require external dependencies which you can install using
*pip*. For the dependencies of each script you should check the accompanying
README.md file or the comments inside the script for further information.

You can execute any given script if it has execution permission set.

Other than that you can execute a script through your Python interpreter.

    $ python script.py [arguments]

Most scripts with command line arguments use docopt for parsing of commands.
Refer to the *help* argument of each script for additional specifications.

## Origin ##

The files in this repository used to be part of my main configuration repository
[neko-config](https://github.com/catlinman/neko-config) which contained everything
from skins to configurations files over to scripts. It has since been split off
into this separate repository which was started from scratch. This means that
for any previous commits made to the files in this repository before November
2017 you should have a look at the original repository over at
[neko-config-origin](https://github.com/catlinman/neko-config-origin).
